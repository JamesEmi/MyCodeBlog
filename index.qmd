<!-- # James Emilian -->

I am a computer vision researcher and biomedical engineer with expertise in **developing multimodal models** and finetuning **foundation models** for on-edge deployment on **robots**, and in **clinical settings**. I am currently a core ML team member at the **DARPA Triage Challenge**, developing **multimodal deep learning models** for battlefield trauma detection. The bulk of my work at CMU has centered around this role - rapid testing and deployment of algorithms for physiological sign sensing using robots. Given our aggressive deployment-first approach, I have more cool videos to show than NeurIPS publications - [see them here](projects.qmd). 

Aside from my work on multimodal algorithms for medical triage robotics, I have worked on the below topics:  
- **Machine Unlearning** for privacy-preserving AI  
- **Imitation Learning** for long-horizon task planning in embodied AI simulations  
- **Uncertainty-aware segmentation models for tumor and pleural effusion segmentation**
