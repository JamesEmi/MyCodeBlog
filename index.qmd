<!-- # James Emilian -->

I am a researcher and engineer with expertise in **Machine Learning**, **Robotics**, and **AI for Healthcare**. My work spans across academia and industry, with a focus on deploying intelligent systems for real-world impact.

I am currently a core ML team member at the **DARPA Triage Challenge**, developing **multimodal deep learning models** for battlefield trauma detection.

I've worked on diverse research areas, including:
- **Machine Unlearning** for privacy-preserving AI
- **Imitation Learning** for long-horizon robotics
- **AI-powered ultrasound diagnostics** for medical applications
